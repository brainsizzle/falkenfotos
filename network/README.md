setup ethernet to fixed port in /etc/dhcpcd.conf
- mind the priorities defined via metrics

setup ethernet on the laptop to use
- 192.168.3.20 / 255.255.255.0 / 192.168.3.1

connect raspi
- ssh pi@192.168.3.10

now all can be done via laptop - no monitor needed anymore for raspi

setup wifi with raspi-config
